# LeetCode Solutions

## Introduction

This repository is a documentation of my journey through problem solving on LeetCode. Here, I share my solutions to various algorithmic problems, primarily solved in Python. The aim is to track my progress, reflect on my problem-solving strategies, and provide a resource for others learning to code and prepare for technical interviews.

## Table of Contents

- [Binary Search](#binary-search)
- [Array](#array)


## Array

- [Running Sum of 1D array](array\running_sum_of_1d_array.py) - A solution to the "Running Sum of 1D Array" problem, which calculates the running sum of an array of integers.

## Binary Search

- [Search Insert Position](binary_search\search_insert_position.py) - A solution for the "Search Insert Position" problem, implementing a binary search algorithm to find the target value or the insert position in a sorted array.


- [Find the Duplicate Number](binary_search/find_the_duplicate_number.py) - Implemented an algorithm to find a duplicate number in an array containing numbers taken from the range 1 to `n`.
- [First Bad Version](binary_search/first_bad_version.py) - Solved using a binary search approach to minimize the number of calls to an API.
- [Guess Number Higher or Lower](binary_search\guess_number_higher_or_lower.py) - An implementation of a classic binary search problem adapted to guessing a number within a range.
- [Valid Perfect Square](binary_search/valid_perfect_square.py) - Wrote a program to check whether a given number is a perfect square without using any built-in library function.
- [Pow(x, n)](binary_search/pow_x_n.py) - Implemented the power function that calculates x raised to the power n (x^n).
- [Sqrt(x)](binary_search/sqrt_x.py) - A solution to compute the square root of x, demonstrating a binary search application.
